Give a brief example of when to use ID (#id) and when to use classes (.class)
in CSS.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
You should use ids if you need to refer to that one specific element. This can
be because of CSS styling, page navigation, indexing, JavaScript, etc. For CSS
specifically, you could choose to use in-line CSS or add an ID and style it in
your CSS file(s).

In CSS, classes should be used to target multiple elements for styling.
There are multiple ways of targeting specific types of elements,
like selecting span tags inside p tags inside div tags using "div > p > span".
There are also pseudo classes like :last-child that selects the last child
element of the parent. If none of those makes sense, you should use a class to
style the object.

TLDR: In CSS, use ids for very specific and "narrow" styling. Use classes for
"broader" and less specific styling.


What does RGBA mean and what colors can you express with it?
------------------------------------------------------------
RGBA is short for red green blue alpha. Alpha specifies the opacity in the
color. While the R, G, and B can be anything in an octet (0-255), the alpha is
a decimal between or equal to 0.0 and 1.0. An alpha of 0.0 means fully
transparent, and an alpha of 1.0 means fully opaque.
