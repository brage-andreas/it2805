			<ol>
				<li>
					The server in a client-server architecture saves and serves the data to the client upon a valid
					request.
				</li>

				<li>The client makes requests to a server, and receives (and often "visualizes") data.</li>

				<li>
					An IP address is a unique address used in requests. IP addresses are used to identify your device
					(phone, router, etc.) but also to geolocate you. IP addresses look like xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx where each
					"xxx" can be anywhere within one octet (0-255).
				</li>

				<li>
					A DNS server is essentially a phonebook, but instead of mapping phone numbers to names, it maps IP
					addresses of websites to a readable domain name like "google.com".
				</li>

				<li>
					This I was unsure about, so I researched it. According to
					<a href="https://www.scaler.com/topics/difference-between-internet-and-www/">scaler.com</a>
					the Internet uses TCP/IP, which essentially is what most people think of as "the internet" (IP
					"navigates" and TCP "sends", making sure not data is missing), while WWW uses HTTP(S), which are the
					websites. So "Internet" is what I would call internet, whilst WWW can be seen as a set of all the
					websites featured.
				</li>

				<li>
					HTML is hypertext markup language. That means that it is a markup language, which means that it
					controls the form/structure of its layout (like .md), whilst also being able to create hypertext,
					which is text mixed with images, videos, sound, etc., but most importantly links to other
					HTML-files.
				</li>

				<li>
					In short, we include the CSS files inside the head and not the body because the head is loaded
					before the body. The body consists of the "physical" content on the website, aka. the images, the
					text, etc. The head features metadata and other "hidden" data the browser needs to correctly display
					the site, like CSS.
				</li>

				<li>
					In-line CSS override rules in a CSS file because the in-line CSS' style applies to this specific
					element, which takes priority over a CSS file's more general rules.
				</li>
